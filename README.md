### Mouse

You can click the mouse on the field, thereby placing the cells.

### Keyboard

**Q** - quit game

**C** - Enable command mode

### Avaliable commands in command mode:

`<required>` - Required argument.

`[optional]` - Optional argument.

- `reset [width] [height]`

Clears the field and resets the steps counter.
If you pass width and height arguments, it creates a field with given width and height.

- `set < position X > < position Y >`

Sets or removes life in a cell.

- `step [steps count or '-']`

Performs the specified number of steps. If there is no argument, it performs 1 step.
If the argument is '-', performs an infinite number of steps, until the key 'I' is pressed.

- `back`

Cancels the last step.
You can not undo more than one step.

- `save [filename]`

Saves field to file.
If no filename is specified, will be used: "game_of_life.fld"

- `load [filename]`

Loads field from file.
If no filename is specified, will be used: "game_of_life.fld"
